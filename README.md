# Some improvement on GUINNESS 

My work is based on https://github.com/HirokiNakahara/GUINNESS. Please check this link for information.

My work:

①　 Add the ResNet and DenseNet modules which can be generated dynamically according to the users’ setting;

②　 Add the function to automatically calculate the number of parameters of the current selected neural network;

③　 Add the function to automatically correct the feature map size according to the context;

④　 Make the layer-choosing function more robust;

⑤　 Add the new parameters compression(quantization) methods called ‘DorefaNet’.

'python gui2.py' to run the code.

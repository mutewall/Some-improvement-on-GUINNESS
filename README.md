# Some-improvement-on-GUINNESS
 
 This work is based on https://github.com/HirokiNakahara/GUINNESS. Please check this link for more information.
 
 My work:
 
 Add the ResNet and DenseNet modules which can be generated dynamically according to the users’ setting;
 
 Add the function to automatically calculate the number of parameters of the current selected neural network;
 
 Add the function to automatically correct the feature map size according to the context;
 
 Make the related layer-choosing functions more robust;
 
 Add the new parameters compression(quantization) methods called ‘DorefaNet’.
